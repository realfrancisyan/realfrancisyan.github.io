Hey, I am Jiajun Yan, a junior Web Developer currently based in Guangzhou, China with strong interests in React, Vue and JavaScript performance.

Graduated from [Cardiff University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_University), Wales with a Master’s degree in Computing (Distinction), where I found myself truly passionate about Web Technologies, travel and making friends.

I am active on social media and also in love with writing blog posts and taking notes. Feel free to ping me on any of the following platforms below.
