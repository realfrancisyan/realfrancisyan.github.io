				<div class="post_content">
					<p>For years, I have been looking for some kind of tutorials, websites and resources which can actually help me improve my design. This requires time, efforts, tactics and most importantly, patience. For many designers, they could probably throw their works that have been done for countless days and nights away as a result of the dissatisfaction of their design. Nobody could always be creative until he finds something that is inspirational. The following list of web pages may help you get hold of the latest trend of design, and some resources are provided, especially for web designers.</p>

					<p>Conducted by designer Ryan Hageman, GURA FIKU is a collection of visual research surveying the history of graphic design in Japan. As an accumulation of Japanese posters possibly produced by students and organizations in Japan, this collection could offer proper guidance to you to get inspirations, enjoy the strong visual experience that you encounter, and ultimately, start to think about your own works.</p>

				<div class="post_content">
					<p>Due to some blog services stripping script tags and thus preventing Medium embeds from functioning, Tumblr is currently not available for users to embed Medium stories directly in posts using its editor. But after several tries I accidentally worked out a way that could make it functional with just a few steps.</p>

					<p>Tumblr provides us great benefits to edit HTML and CSS code which enable us to create complex layouts. As a result, we can intuitively add the following single line of code to our themes to meet the requirement of Medium embeds.</p>

					<p>On July 29th, the new member from the Windows family, Windows 10, was available for download, prior to its main competitor OS X El Capitan officially released in September. Compared with Mac OS X, Windows certainly has its great benefits, offering a much wider variety of games, better gaming performance and software support. For ones including me who want to play games on PCs without losing some of the main features provided by a retina MacBook Pro, here is how we could do to address the issues.</p>
