					<p>On July 29th, the new member from the Windows family, Windows 10, was available for download, prior to its main competitor OS X El Capitan officially released in September. Compared with Mac OS X, Windows certainly has its great benefits, offering a much wider variety of games, better gaming performance and software support. For ones including me who want to play games on PCs without losing some of the main features provided by a retina MacBook Pro, here is how we could do to address the issues.</p>

					<div class="subtitle">
						<h2>Adjusting Viewing Experience for Retina Display</h2>
					</div>

					<div class="post_image">
						<div sytle="vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box;">

						<div class="foot_note">
							<span>Change the overall size to 200%</span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>After Windows 10 installation, you may encounter some hiccups with your screen. Everything looks tiny, including texts, software programs and more. But here is a fix: on desktop, right click your mouse and choose “Display Settings”, then move the scroll bar blow the text saying “Change the size of text, apps, and other items” to 200% (Recommended). After that, apply the setting and relog on your computer. Now your laptop fits completely fine with the current resolution.</p>

					<div class="subtitle">
						<h2>Trackpad Experience</h2>
					</div>

					<p>Mac OS X offers a smooth trackpad experience with gorgeous multi-gestures. And to continue to improve its overall performance, many Mac users utilizes a variety of third-party applications, such as Better Touch Tool and Jitouch. The alternative tool on Windows similar to these applications is Trackpad++, which serves almost the same functions, with support for built-in trackpad only. But one thing to note is that it is not technically a “freeware” and it requires donation with whatever amount unless you want to give it a reinstallation week after week to keep it free.</p>

					<div class="subtitle">
						<h2>Network Monitor</h2>
					</div>

					<div class="image-left" id="icon-size"><img src="img/monitor.jpg" alt="Monitor"></div>

					<p>iStat Menus is a must have software for all Mac users, keeping track of your computer’s network, hard drives, CPU and temperature etc. However, on Windows 10, things could be way difficult. But to stalk network information NetSpeedMonitor is a great tool to show current bitrates of your internet connection right on your taskbar. The information of both upload and download speed is shown correctly in every second on Windows 10, but due to the compatibility issue, users should change its compatibility mode to Windows 7 to make it function as normal.</p>
