					<h1><a href="">Learning to Use Sketch</a></h1>
				</div>
				<div class="post_content">
					<p>I understand it is a little bit late to introduce Sketch, the prestigious UI design software that could be a Photoshop or Illustrator killer app, which has been released a couple of years ago. The main reason that Sketch could be a Photoshop killer is that it shrinks PS’s image editing functions, but instead it provides a cleaner user interface that helps designers, especially those UI designers, to concentrate more on their crafts. Compared with Adobe, Bohemian Coding, a relatively smaller firm building Sketch, responds quicker to users’ suggestions and modifies the app’s functions easier to suit customers’ needs. With its clean and intuitive-to-use design, Sketch immediately becomes UI designers’ best tool for crafting.</p>

					<p>Niice is a pretty simple tool that helps you quickly search out the photos that would inspire you. With its gorgeous website which enables you to draw inspiration with your computer, Niice has a companion iPhone application available for free on the App Store that keeps you inspired, organizes your best picks, etc. Surprise me, one of Niice’s key features, makes searching a lot interesting, as it is like “I am feeling lucky” from Google that could provide some great bits of images even when you do not come up with an idea of what you really want to create at the moment.</p>

					<p>Cautiously designed by Russian designer Vladimir Kudinov, Hue is a set of Apple-style gradients that can be used for various projects, both personally and commercially. If you are a huge fan of full-page background images, then Hue is the right thing that suits you. Showcasing your hardware or an application within MacBook mockups could not be much easier, for these background gradients can intuitively be modified and match the style of your products. Use properly, and your pages will certainly capture your audiences’ eyeballs.</p>

					<p>The following video reflects how Hue is used. (Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&v=cknyJLN78g0">Youtube</a>)</p>
